## Definition

A data type is a classification that specifies which type of value a data has and what type of operations can be applied to it.

In our first program, `"Hello, world!"` data type is a string of characters, or simply a _string_. `42` is a number.

There are many ways to categorize and group data types. For instance, _numbers_ can be further subdived in _integers_ (whole numbers like `1`, `42`) and _floating points_ or _floats_ (like `1.234`). But you may encounter the more mathematical term _Real_ to designate them. It depends on the context and... the language.

Programming languages have **primitive data types**. They are the data types from which all other data types are constructed. To make matters more confusing, some primitive data types may be considered _derived_ primitive data types.

The Go [language specification](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Types)[^go-spec-types] should settle the debate.

In this chapter, we shall have a look at some basic datatypes.
