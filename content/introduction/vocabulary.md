## Vocabulary

_Programming_ means writing a _program_ that resolves a _problem_. A program is said to be _correct_ if, for every _input_, it terminates consistently with the correct _output_ and solves the given problem. An _algorithm_ contains a sequence of steps to solve a problem. A program formally describes an algorithm. The program is _executed_ by a computer _processor_. The program is written in a _programming language_ according to a predefined _syntax_. The computer processor (CPU) cannot execute it directly. Tools like an _interpreter_ or a _compiler_ are needed.
