## Itâ€™s about programming

This book is first about **programming, algorithms and data structures**. Of course, Go will be our reference language, and for sure, you will learn Go along the way. But the techniques presented in this book will also be transferable to a large extent to other programming languages like Python, Java or C.

We will cover one single programming paradigm: **imperative programming**. Other paradigms such as object oriented programming are not in the scope of this book.

We will take the time to understand what is going on under the hood. A tutorial will usually give you a recipe to solve a specific problem, without necessarily discuss the underlying algorithm. For instance, you can be given instructions on how to sort a list using a library or a built-in function, but it will probably not discuss how sorting a list actually works.

This book covers the equivalent of one semester or more of first year computer science class. It is **designed for beginners** who want to acquire a good grasp on algorithms and data structures. **Teachers** on the other hand can use it as a classroom support and leverage its numerous exercises, while focusing on teaching the material.

Go may seem a peculiar choice to learn programming. We will discuss the reasons of this choice and its merits, with background information on the language.
