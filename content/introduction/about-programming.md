## Itâ€™s about programming

This book is first about **programming, algorithms and data structures**. Of course, Go will be our reference language, and for sure, the reader will learn Go along the way. But the techniques and the concepts presented are transferable to a large extent to other programming languages like Python, Java or C.

We will cover one single programming paradigm: **imperative programming**. Other paradigms such as object oriented programming are not in the scope of this book.

This book covers the equivalent of one semester or more of first year computer science class. It is **designed for beginners** who want to acquire a good grasp on algorithms and data structures.

Go may seem a peculiar choice to learn programming. We will discuss the reasons of this choice and its merits, with background information on the language.
