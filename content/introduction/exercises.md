## Exercises

Solving exercises is a key part of the learning process.

This book offers numerous exercises. The most efficient method is to solve them completely. First, write your resolution steps on paper in pseudo-code. Then, once you are confident with what you have written on paper, write the corresponding program in Go and run it. Improve it until it is satisfactory.

Heading straight to the solution and thinking that “you get it” does not bear the same teaching value as actually resolving the exercise yourself, which may involve sweat and tears, and sometimes getting stuck. If you find yourself blocked, take a break, or try another exercise before going back to the challenging part. Only through hard personal work will you progress. Do not despair if you spend one hour on a single exercise: this is perfectly normal.

You don’t have to resolve all the exercices; however you are advised to a least test your skills on some of them, including the hardest ones. You should at least be confident you *could* solve the others as well before proceeding to the next chapters.
