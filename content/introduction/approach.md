## Approach

We will take a **non-formal, intuitive and practical approach** to programming, heavily based on exercises of increasing complexity, adding the minimum amount of theory necessary as we progress to solve them.

For **beginners**, the first part lays the foundation of programming. Variables, loops, conditional statements and functions found in most languages will be presented. At this stage, you will be able to solve simple problems, like checking if a paper fits in an enveloppe.

We will continue with more advanced data structures. Slices and maps are the bread and butter of Go programs. We will read data from files and manipulate them. From there, you can already go a long way and write useful programs. At that point, implementing games like Blackjack or Hangman is in reach.

We will extend these data structures to form lists, linked lists, queues, stack and trees to mention the most common ones. At this  **intermediate** level, we will talk about recursion, backtracking, space and time complexity, finite automatons. We will solve both fun and classical academic problems like the eight queens problem, the towers of Hanoi, or implement the classical Conwayâ€™s game of life;, and more.
