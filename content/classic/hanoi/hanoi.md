## Tower of Hanoi

**Learn recursion with this classical problem.**

### Presentation

The Tower of Hanoi[^hanoi] is a mathematical game or puzzle consisting of three rods (or sticks) and a number of disks (or pegs) of different diameters, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top.

[^hanoi]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi

For instance, let us label the 3 rods `A`, `B` and `C` and use 3 disks `{3, 2, 1}`, `3` being the largest:

```
A = {3, 2, 1}
B = {}
C = {}
```

### Rules

The objective is to move the entire stack to the last rod, obeying the following simple rules:

1. Only one disk may be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.

The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is $2^n âˆ’ 1$, where $n$ is the number of disks.

### Recursive method

If we only display the moves and not the rods successive states, we do not even need a data structure to represent the rods and the disks. This solution is straightforward, at the cost of testability.

To $solve(n, A, B, C)$ for $n$ disks using pegs $A$ (**source**), $B$ (**auxiliary**) and $C$ (**destination**) with $n>0$:

1. $solve(n-1, A, C, B)$
2. $move(A, C)$
3. $solve(n-1, B, A, C)$

To phrase it in a more casual form, say you are asked to solve for $n$ pegs, but you don't know how to do it. But you know a friend that can solve it for $n-1$. How? That's none of your concern, but it turns out that your friend delegates for $n-2$ to yet another person, and so on. Eventually, there's that special someone that can solve it for $n=1$. It is a trivial case: they must simply move the top peg.

So to solve for $(n, A, B, C)$, you call your friend to solve for $(n-1, A, C, B)$. Then you call the special someone to move the top peg from $A$ to $C$. You call your friend again, this time to solve $(n-1, B, A, C)$.

```go
func solve(n int, source, auxiliary, destination string) {
	if n == 0 {
		return
	}
	solve(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)
	fmt.Printf("Move from %s to %s\n", source, destination)
	solve(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination)
}

func main() {
	solve(4, "A", "B", "C")
}
```

And that's it! Problem solved, no sweat.

### Iterative method

The iterative approach is much more involved than the recursive one. It requires to create a type `Tower`. Each rod is an `[]int` labelled by a string.

```go
type Tower struct {
	n int
	rods map[string][]int
}

func (tower *Tower) String() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("%v", tower.rods)
}
```

Provide a new tower constructor based on the number of disks:

```go
func NewTower(n int) *Tower {
	var disks []int
	for i := n; i > 0; i-- {
		disks = append(disks, i)
	}
	tower := &Tower{n,make(map[string][]int)}
	tower.rods["A"] = disks  // descending [3, 2, 1]
	tower.rods["B"] = make([]int, 0)
	tower.rods["C"] = make([]int, 0)
	return tower
}
```

We will need to `swap` disks "smartly", depending on the rod's configuration.

```go
func (tower *Tower) swap(x, y string) {
	topDiskX := tower.topDisk(x)
	topDiskY := tower.topDisk(y)
	if topDiskX == 0 && topDiskY == 0 {
		return
	}
	if (topDiskX < topDiskY && topDiskX != 0) || topDiskY == 0 {
		tower.move(x, y)
	} else {
		tower.move(y, x)
	}
}
```

Return the top disk of the given rod:

```go
func (tower *Tower) topDisk(rod string) int {
	count := len(tower.rods[rod])
	if count == 0 {
		return 0
	}
	return tower.rods[rod][count-1]
}
```

We need to be able to move a disk from one rod to another:

```go
func (tower *Tower) move(from, to string) {
	fmt.Println(tower)
	fmt.Printf("Move from %s to %s\n", from, to)
	countFrom := len(tower.rods[from])
	topFrom := tower.rods[from][countFrom - 1]
	tower.rods[from] = tower.rods[from][:countFrom - 1]
	tower.rods[to] = append(tower.rods[to], topFrom)
}
```

We know we are done when the destination disk `C` contains all the disks, that is, its size is the size `n` of the tower.

```go
func (tower *Tower) isDone() bool {
	return len(tower.rods["C"]) == tower.n
}
```

At last, to put it all together, we have two sets of rules:

- Even number of disks
- Odd number of disks

For an even number of disks:

2. Make the legal move between rods $A$ and $C$ (in either direction),
1. Make the legal move between rods $A$ and $B$ (in either direction),
3. Make the legal move between rods $B$ and $C$ (in either direction),

For an odd number of disks:

1. make the legal move between rods $A$ and $C$ (in either direction),
2. make the legal move between rods $A$ and $B$ (in either direction),
3. make the legal move between rods $B$ and $C$ (in either direction),

Repeat the steps until complete.

The part "in either direction" explains why we designed a generic function `swap()` that is able to `move(x, y)` or `move(y, x)`.

We can now solve according to our algorithm above.

```go
func (tower *Tower) solve() {
	var steps [][]string

	if tower.n % 2 == 0 {
		steps = [][]string{{"A", "B"}, {"A", "C"}, {"B", "C"}}
	} else {
		steps = [][]string{{"A", "C"}, {"A", "B"}, {"B", "C"}}
	}
	for {
		for _, step := range steps {
			tower.swap(step[0], step[1])
			if tower.isDone() {
				return
			}
		}
	}
}
```

The implementation requires us to retain the tower's state after each step. A `main` function will help our algorithm come to life.

```go
func main() {
	tower := NewTower(4)
	tower.solve()
	fmt.Println(tower)
}
```
