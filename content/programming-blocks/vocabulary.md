# Vocabulary

While we said we would take a practical approach, a bit a vocabulary will certainly not hurt.

## Computer programming

**Computer programming** is the process of designing and building an executable computer program for accomplishing a specific computing task [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming)]. This task can be printing a report, sending an email, operating a robotic arm, cheating on emission testing, or displaying pixels on a screen.

Programs are **written once**, but **read many times**. They are meant to be read by humans first, and by machines incidentally. In order to create programs readable by others (or simply by yourself later), we follow certain principles to ensure readability. In large projets, cruft is easily accumulated, one line at the time, leading to systems that are fragile, difficult to maintain and to reason about.

## Bugs

An error in a program is called a **bug**. It has been estimated that a bug appears every 1,000 lines of code [TAN]. No all of them have the same severity. Its manifestation can be a slightly unclear message on the screen, or an abrupt termination (abnormal end or *abend*; a crash if you prefer). The consequences of a bug can vary greatly, from mild annoyance like a missing extra topping on a pizza, to loss of business and money, for instance with the failure to complete a shopping transaction, or the explosion of a rocket. In the worst cases, is can result in human harm. We must write programs and design systems to be confident that they will perform correctly, according to the context.

## Algorithm and data structures

An **algorithm** is a computable set of steps to achieve a desired result [[NIST](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/algorithm.html)]. A **data structure** is a way to organize information.

## Software and application

*Program*, *software* and *application* are often used interchangeably. To make a distinction, **software** is an all-encompassing term that covers programs and is used in constrast with hardware. An **application** is a program or group of programs that is designed for the user.
